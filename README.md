## üéØ Purpose

This project aims to enhance strategic decision-making in the mobile retail sector through a data-driven sales analytics dashboard. Built entirely in Microsoft Power BI, the solution leverages Power Query, DAX, and interactive visuals to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and brand trends across India.

The dashboard is designed for retail managers, marketing teams, and business analysts, transforming raw transactional data into a dynamic, filterable interface. It supports smarter inventory planning, targeted promotions, and a deeper understanding of consumer preferences. The solution is scalable, visually intuitive, and accessible via the Power BI Service‚Äîmaking it ideal for both internal reporting and public portfolio sharing.

## üìÅ Data Overview

This project is based on a publicly available dataset from a Github repositry. The dataset contains 3835 records and 14 columns, each representing key attributes of mobile phone sales such as transaction details, customer ratings, brand, and product specifications.

## üßæ Dataset Summary

- **Format**: Excel 
- **Rows**: 3835 (including header)  
- **Columns**: 14 
- **Time Period Covered**: 2021 to 2024 (based on dates)

---

## üîç Initial Data Observations

The dataset appeared mostly clean and structured, but a few adjustments were necessary to prepare it for analysis and dashboard creation:

- Dates were split across three columns: Year, Month, and Date. These needed to be merged into a single column to support time-based filtering and trend analysis.
- The Day Name column contained inconsistent values (e.g., "Fr" and "Friday") that required standardization for accurate weekday-level insights.
- No direct column for Total Sale or Profit was available. However, Unit Sold and Price per Unit were present, allowing us to derive Total Sales using a calculated column.
- No blank or empty cells were found in the dataset, which minimized the need for null handling.

---

## üì• Data Loading

The dataset was first imported into Excel and then loaded into Power BI for transformation and modeling:

- Imported the raw data into Excel using:  
  **Data tab ‚Üí Get Data ‚Üí From File ‚Üí From Text/CSV**

- Verified the column structure and data types in the Navigator window to ensure proper alignment and formatting.

- Loaded the dataset into **Power BI Power Query Editor** for further cleaning and transformation before integrating it into the data model.

## üí° Data Exploration and Key Insights

After completing the data cleaning and transformation steps, I explored the dataset using Power BI visuals and DAX measures to uncover trends in sales performance, customer behavior, a
nd brand dynamics. The following insights were identified:

- Sales remained consistent across the three-year period, with slight dips observed in February and September.
- Thursday and Saturday emerged as the highest-performing days in terms of total sales volume.
- Vivo and Apple were the top-performing brands, both in terms of revenue and customer satisfaction.
- The best-selling models were Vivo S1 (‚Çπ6.6M), Vivo V20 (‚Çπ6.4M), and iPhone 11 (‚Çπ5.7M).
- Cash and UPI were the most preferred payment methods, together accounting for over 50% of all transactions.
- Customer ratings were mostly positive, with the majority of feedback falling in the 4‚Äì5 star range.
- Sales were concentrated in metro cities, indicating stronger demand in urban regions.
- No extreme seasonal spikes were observed, suggesting steady demand throughout the year.
